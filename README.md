# Shortenator - A (poorly named) Express + MongoDB + React URL Shortener
I don't really have anything to say on this one. I kind of made it just because I was bored and this was a relatively simple project that had been sitting in my ideas list for a while. I guess more practice with Express and React is always a good thing.

## Preview
Like I said I made it because I was bored, so nothing too crazy. Definitely not on the level of effort I went through with [PasteMate's design](https://github.com/AWilliams17/PasteMate#preview).
